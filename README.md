# Motivation

My friends wanted a weeding site so I was looking to experiment with some new tools and I found [Poi](https://poi.js.org/).

## Today

They just needed a link with the pictures after the weading so I deleted all the files and project as it had some legacy packages and I copied the compiled version.

I'll leave the features and credits here as a memory of what I did one day.

## Features

This is project is based on the [Vue-Land](https://github.com/vue-land/create-vue-app) template that has already some interesting features like PWA, hot reloading, normalize etc. I also added

- Vue router
- Poi 10
- Deployment to Firebase using Travis CI
